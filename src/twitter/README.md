# Partial Twitter SDK

This folder includes helper classes for accessing the
[Twitter Premium v1.1 API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/premium). This is far from a comprehensive
SDK for this API and focuses on PowerTrack streaming support.

For additional functionality, please look to Twitter's
newer [v2 API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api).
